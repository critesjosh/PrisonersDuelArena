Introduction
============

This is the documentation for the Prisoner's Dilemma Simulator, an advanced simulation platform
that leverages AI and interactive tools for dynamic strategy exploration and comparative analysis.
The simulator provides a comprehensive environment for studying game theory and decision-making
through the lens of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma problem.

Key Features
===========

* Interactive Strategy Creation - Design and test your own strategies
* AI-Powered Strategy Interpretation - Natural language processing of strategy descriptions
* Multiple Game Modes - Tournament, round-robin, and custom match configurations
* Rich Visualization - Dynamic charts and graphs for strategy performance analysis
* Built-in Strategy Templates - Pre-defined strategies ranging from basic to advanced
* Advanced Analysis Tools - Detailed statistics and performance metrics

Getting Started
==============

To get started with the simulator, check out the following sections:

* :doc:`modules/game_logic` - Core game mechanics and scoring rules
* :doc:`modules/strategy_interpreter` - AI-powered strategy interpretation system
* :doc:`modules/strategy_templates` - Pre-defined strategy templates and examples
* :doc:`modules/main` - Main application interface and configuration

Architecture Overview
===================

The simulator is built with a modular architecture:

1. **Game Logic Module** - Implements core game mechanics
2. **Strategy Interpreter** - Converts natural language to game logic
3. **Strategy Templates** - Provides reusable strategy patterns
4. **Main Application** - Handles user interface and coordination

API Reference
============

For detailed API documentation, refer to:

* :ref:`modindex` - Complete list of modules
* :ref:`genindex` - Index of all functions and classes
* :ref:`search` - Search through documentation

Development
==========

The project uses:

* Python 3.10+
* OpenAI GPT for strategy interpretation
* Streamlit for the web interface
* Sphinx for documentation
